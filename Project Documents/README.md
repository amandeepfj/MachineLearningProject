**This document briefs roughly the steps I will or have taken**

- Understand the business understanding/problem statement.
- Install SQLite and dump csv files in it to access the files in notebook.
- Start with data understanding - This will be done in a python notebook.
- Start with simple modeling to determine how the results will look like.
- Deploy the model and expose the results RESTful API.

1. Business Understanding/ Problem statement:
<br>The data about the users assessments, courses, and users is present. The project will aim at finding the similar users based on a scoring factor. 
<br>The results has to be accessible via RESTful API. The endpoint should take use id as input and return a summary of most similar users.
<br> We are using SQLlite as backend.

2. Data Understanding

...Steps will be added as I move through the project.
